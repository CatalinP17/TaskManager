This is a tidied up version of the Lecture Code presented to support the development of the Phase2 Model Implementation for TaskManager
You can use this in a number of ways: 
1) For educational purposes i.e to review what was done in the Software Application Development Unit 2.2 in conjunction with the videos and to get ideas for modifying or boosting your Phase 2 Model Implementation 
2) To boost your Phase 2 implementation model directly by incorporating code from this project (please acknowledge where you have done this) 
3) By using this code wholesale as a starting point for your Phase 3 implementation Health warning. 
If you adopt to do 2) or 3) then you need to be sure that you completely understand the context, purpose and workings of this code with respect to the Phase 3 Coursework There are no detailed javadoc comments in the Project, deliberately! i.e. You can use the Javadoc sections to put in your own comments about the workings of the code as a way of mitigating the 'health warning'! 
For example, ff you cannot complete the javadoc then you don't really understand the model. 
Lectures as part of 'Unit 2.3 Desktop Application Development - GUI and MVC' will refer to the source of this code and may modify it.
